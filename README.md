# Ubuntu User Management Guide

This guide provides a detailed overview of user management in Ubuntu, including commands and explanations for creating, modifying, and managing users and groups.

## 1. Creating a New User

To create a new user in Ubuntu, use the `adduser` command. This will prompt you to set a password and enter additional information for the new user.

```bash
sudo adduser <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo adduser johndoe
```

This command creates a new user named `johndoe` and sets up a home directory at `/home/johndoe`.

## 2. Assigning a User to a Group

To add a user to a specific group, use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option. This allows the user to retain membership in other groups while being added to the new group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo johndoe
```

This adds `johndoe` to the `sudo` group, granting administrative privileges.

## 3. Setting or Changing a User's Password

To set or change a user's password, use the `passwd` command.

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo passwd johndoe
```

This sets or changes the password for the user `johndoe`.

## 4. Deleting a User

To delete a user from the system, use the `deluser` command. By default, this does not remove the user's home directory.

```bash
sudo deluser <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo deluser johndoe
```

To delete a user and their home directory:

```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home johndoe
```

## 5. Viewing User Information

To view a user's ID (UID), group ID (GID), and groups they belong to, use the `id` command.

```bash
id <username>
```

Example:
```bash
id johndoe
```

To list all users on the system, use:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

## 6. Switching Between Users

To switch to another user account, use the `su` (substitute user) command.

```bash
su - <username>
```

Example:
```bash
su - johndoe
```

To execute a single command as another user:

```bash
sudo -u <username> <command>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo -u johndoe ls /home/johndoe
```

## 7. Locking and Unlocking a User Account

To lock a user account, preventing them from logging in, use the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -L <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -L johndoe
```

To unlock a user account:

```bash
sudo usermod -U <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -U johndoe
```

## 8. Adding and Managing Groups

To create a new group, use the `addgroup` command:

```bash
sudo addgroup <groupname>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo addgroup developers
```

To delete a group:

```bash
sudo delgroup <groupname>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo delgroup developers
```

To list the groups a user belongs to:

```bash
groups <username>
```

Example:
```bash
groups johndoe
```

## 9. Setting User Expiry Date

To set an account expiry date for a user:

```bash
sudo chage -E <YYYY-MM-DD> <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo chage -E 2024-12-31 johndoe
```

To view account expiry information:

```bash
sudo chage -l <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo chage -l johndoe
```

## 10. Changing a Userâ€™s Shell

To change the default shell for a user:

```bash
sudo chsh -s <shell> <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh johndoe
```

This sets Zsh as the default shell for `johndoe`.

## 11. Temporary User Privileges (sudo)

To run a command as the root user:

```bash
sudo <command>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

To grant a user sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo johndoe
```

## 12. Monitoring User Activity

To see who is currently logged into the system:

```bash
who
```

To see the last login times for users:

```bash
last <username>
```

To monitor real-time login attempts:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```
